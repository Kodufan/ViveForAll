# ViveForAll
 Neos mod that brings HTC Vive single button App / Localspace toggle functionality to other controllers
 
 ## How it works
 At the very least, this mod will combine your upper face button into both your radial menu key and dashboard / legacy world switcher menu just like the HTC Vive controller behavior. This frees up the bottom buttons on each controller. As of writing this, there are two hotkeys they can be bound to: A quick microphone toggle, and jump. This means you never need to click sticks or use a double press to jump again. Depending on how much of FrooxEngine I can wrap my head around, other features may be added. While it is possible to set the config to Photo or Undo, those are both functionally identical to None.
